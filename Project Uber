#We are trying to develop a program that will determine the likelyhood of a passenger being intoxicated based on the time of day, pickup location, day of week, etc.

#----------------------------------

#import or create a function which intergrates GPS to determined location. Or a function that will allow the program to utilize Uber's internal GPS.

#----------------------------------

# create function to define intoxication

#intox = intoxication/intoxicated
def intox():
    return

# create a var to establish the legal limit of location

#legal_bal = Legal Blood Alochol Limit
legal_bal = float(0.08)

current_bal = float(0.08)

if current_bal > legal_bal:
    intox = True
    print("customer may be intoxicated")
else:
    intox = False
    print("customer is not intoxicated")
