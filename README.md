Hello, my name is Darrien Chandler. I've been teaching myself computer programming since October of 2020. 
I started with Python and have since expanded to JS,HTML, and CSS.
This is a portfolio of some my work. I know they're not perfect but someone on Youtube once told me (well not me specifically) "just send it".
So, here's what I can do so far. I hope you love it, or at least like it LOL. 
I am always eager to learn and grow.
Lastly, HIRE ME!!
